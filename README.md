## 📝️ How it Works?
This software requires ports 80 and 443 to run, so these ports must not be reserved on your system. On Windows, the software starts by double-clicking the executable file. However, on Linux, first grant execution permission to the file and then run it as follows:

```bash
chmod +x AbdalFakeWebServer
./AbdalFakeWebServer
```
